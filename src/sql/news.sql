Your home could be next', 'Ai data centercurrently provides 92% of a technological campus’ heating demand.', 'AI’s energy problem may also be its solution, as hyperscalers and governments are increasingly exploring opportunities to repurpose excess heat from data centers.', '<p>Students at a tech university in Dublin are enjoying an unexpected perk of artificial intelligence — it’s helping heat their campus.</p><p>Since 2023, the Technological University of Dublin’s Tallaght campus has been one of a growing number of buildings in the southwest suburban area of the city to be heated by waste heat from a nearby Amazon Web Services data center.</p><p>Data centers have always generated excess heat, but integration with district heating networks has been slow, as the waste heat produced by these power-hungry facilities is typically too low-temperature to directly warm other buildings.</p><p>That’s now changing. As the AI boom gets underway and data centers are increasingly filled with racks of advanced chips that require as much as triple the computing capacity of before, operators have had to find new ways to balance maximizing efficiency without sacrificing sustainability.</p><p>AI is the “twist” that makes it more attractive, according to Adam Fabricius, commercial manager at heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment provider Sav Systems, and a researcher of heat networks for its sister company EnergiRaven.</p><p>“The exciting thing is that AI can give you higher temperatures, and the water cooling makes it a lot easier. You need a lot less hardware to connect these systems,” he told CNBC.</p><p>Providing heat to a district heating network gives data centers “additional social license,” the International Energy Agency’s Brendan Reidenbach told CNBC.</p><p>“It may not be ultimately very cost effective on paper, but it does contribute to that good social impact by turning what is a potential bad news story of increased data centers into a good-news story of what is ultimately decarbonized heat supply. So it’s very much a win-win situation,” he added.</p><p>Ireland a ‘blank slate’</p><p>There has been a fair uptake among Big Tech. Microsoft</p><p>announced plans to fuel the Høje-Taastrup district heating network in Denmark; an Equinix</p><p>data center heats 1,000 homes in Paris; and Google</p><p>announced a major heat recovery project at its facility in Hamina, Finland.</p><p>Ireland was one of two European countries to enforce a moratorium on new data center applications as the power-hungry facilities strained Dublin’s grid, consuming 22% of the small country’s power in 2024. Ireland eventually eased its moratorium late last year as the AI boom saw sentiment U-turn on the economic potential of the facilities.</p><p>Ireland is “effectively a blank slate,” as the country has not had a district heating system before, said the IEA’s Reidenbach. The Tallaght scheme shows the benefits of integrated planning because it brings together the power system operator and the distribution grid operator, he said.</p><p>In 2020, local government formed Ireland’s first not-for-profit energy utility, Heat Works. Waste heat from the nearby AWS data center supplies 100% of the heat to the network.</p><p>“While we are only in the second year of monitoring, we have evidence that the project has limited our exposure to market price shocks generally,” Rosie Webb, head of decarbonization at TU Dublin, told CNBC via email.</p><p>The campus abated around 704 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2024 despite the additional energy demand from two new buildings being added to the site, according to TU Dublin’s calculations.</p><p>AWS’ data center in Tallaght offers a “unique opportunity” to reuse heat, according to the company’s country lead Niamh Gallagher. The scheme, which sees AWS provide recycled heat free of charge, was initially planned to heat 55,000 square meters of public buildings, an area three times the size of the city’s Croke Park stadium pitch, as well as commercial space and 133 apartments.</p><p>“It’s a win-win when we can identify a special project that uses our infrastructure to support the climate goals of the community,” Gallagher told CNBC.</p><p>Keeping hot chips cool</p><p>When it comes to heating networks, Europe is far more advanced in comparison to the U.S., according to Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.</p><p>Some medium-sized data centers that are located closer to metropolitan areas are likely in the best position to deliver waste heat, Hertz-Shargel said. He added that Equinix — which, like AWS, does not make a profit from the waste heat it supplies — is an example of this.</p><p>However, delays with permitting and the high capex costs of constructing heat networks and integrating data centers to the system make scaling the model challenging.</p><p>There’s also the life cycle mismatch. A district heating network is typically given a 30-year life span, Reidenbach said, while the equipment inside a data center is only given seven-to-10 years. “That does leave a very large risk of stranded assets,” he added.</p><p>We see data centers as energy borrowers, and actually as energy generating.</p><p>Kenneth O’Mahony</p><p>Nexalus CEO</p><p>Nexalus, a thermal and science engineering company that patented its technology from Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, investigated ways to capture heat from the hot GPUs and CPUs that data centers house.</p><p>The company uses jet impingement liquid cooling to enhance the performance of the chips while capturing waste heat at a much higher temperature. Instead of producing “low-grade” heat, the system delivers output at roughly 55 to 60 degrees Celsius without the use of heat pumps — hot enough to be reused directly for district heating, Nexalus CEO Kenneth O’Mahony told CNBC.</p><p>Other data centers typically release excess heat at around 30 to 35 degrees Celsius, making it far less practical to repurpose, according to the company, which also maps the heat coming off chips so that it can target the hottest areas for cooling.</p><p>“It’s like a shower head in the shower. If you’ve got a pain in your shoulder, you turn it to the spot where you want it to go.

(4, 'How digital banking is not having benefits for Irish households', 'The \'squeezed\' middle class report no benefit from digital banking', 'Analysis: New research has found that digital banking technology is not improving the financial well-being of the squeezed middle in Ireland', 'Ireland has embraced digital banking with enthusiasm. With fintech adoption rates of 71% compared to the global average of 64% according to the EY Global FinTech Adoption Index, the country stands among Europe\'s most digitalised economies. Yet new research shows a troubling disconnect: this widespread technology adoption is not translating into improved financial outcomes for ordinary households.\r\n\r\nThe study in the Journal of Consumer Policy by researchers at the Cork University Business School at UCC analysed data from 11,128 Irish households using the Survey on Income and Living Conditions and found that digital banking technology has no direct effect on financial wellbeing. This finding carries significant implications for consumer protection policy across Europe, where governments have invested heavily in digital infrastructure on the assumption that expanded access will automatically benefit consumers.\r\n\r\n\'The squeezed middle\'\r\nThe study finds that the \"squeezed middle\" household, those between the 20th and 70th income percentiles, experience no improvement in their financial wellbeing despite having access to digital financial tools. These households represent the majority of Irish society: ordinary working people caught between income thresholds, earning too much to qualify for targeted supports yet not enough to access sophisticated financial services. The data reveals that young adults remain in negative financial territory through the 70th income percentile, despite 96.2% technology access among this cohort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom RTÉ Radio 1\'s Today with Claire Byrne, who are the squeezed middle?\r\n\r\nThis finding takes on particular significance given the financial pressures facing young Irish people. Central Statistics Office research indicates that one in four young women report skipping meals due to financial concerns, while 94% cite poverty in Ireland as a matter of concern. A recent survey found that 84% of people in Ireland are worried about the cost-of-living crisis, with almost half fearing they will not meet household costs in the year ahead.\r\n\r\nWhy is tech failing to improve consumers\' financial welfare?\r\nThe research identifies three reasons why technology access fails to improve consumer welfare.\r\n\r\nCapability mismatch\r\n\r\nThis occurs when technological resources exceed consumers\' capabilities to utilise them effectively. Having access to sophisticated financial tools does not ensure that individuals can navigate complex interfaces, understand algorithmic recommendations or make informed decisions about the options presented to them.\r\n\r\nThe Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has noted that just 57% of Irish adults meet the minimum OECD level of financial literacy. As highlighted by recent analysis on how financial literacy affects consumer decisions, digital payment convenience can make consumers \"tap happy\" and less mindful of spending, compounding the disconnect between technology access and genuine financial capability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom RTÉ Brainstorm, 3 misunderstandings about money that could cost a lot in the long term\r\n\r\nEconomic constraints override\r\n\r\nUnderlying economic barriers can overwhelm any potential technology benefits. When housing costs consume a substantial proportion of household income and 11.7% of people remain at risk of poverty, technology-based interventions cannot address fundamental economic challenges. The OECD\'s 2025 Economic Survey of Ireland highlights how housing affordability challenges have significant societal and distributional implications, while the Department of Finance\'s Future 40 report suggests that Ireland\'s housing crisis could persist for at least another 15 years.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction illusion\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction illusion emerges when technology increases perceived control without improving objective outcomes. The study found that nearly one-third of technology\'s influence operates through psychological rather than material channels. Users may feel more in control of their finances through spending tracking and categorisation features while their actual financial position deteriorates. Dutch research has documented that contactless payments reduce the psychological discomfort of spending, leading to increased expenditure without corresponding satisfaction gains, while separate research demonstrates that using a mobile phone to pay bills has a strong negative effect on having regular savings.\r\n\r\nUnexpected results\r\nThe research also produced several unexpected results. Rural households achieve 4.6% better financial wellbeing than urban households despite lower technology adoption rates. This challenges the widespread assumption that digital transformation is inherently beneficial and suggests that some communities may have developed effective non-digital financial management strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom RTÉ Radio 1\'s Countrywide, why are beef prices going up?\r\n\r\nA gender paradox also emerged from the data. Women demonstrated superior financial behaviours, better budgeting practices and higher savings rates, yet reported significantly lower financial satisfaction and lower technology usage than men. This pattern, documented across 28 countries internationally, suggests structural barriers that competent financial behaviour alone cannot overcome.\r\n\r\nImmigration status creates the largest technology gap at 40.7%, yet technology access fails to explain welfare disparities between immigrants and native-born residents. Immigrants with technology access still demonstrate persistent satisfaction deficits and elevated financial difficulties, indicating that language barriers, credential non-recognition and discrimination in credit markets create constraints that technology cannot address.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean for consumer policy?\r\nIreland\'s banking landscape has shifted significantly since 2018, with widespread branch closures directing customers toward digital channels. Against this backdrop, the Government recently published the country\'s first National Financial Literacy Strategy. Yet consumer sentiment data shows Irish households remain concerned about their finances even as wages rise, suggesting a disconnect between headline economic indicators and lived experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom RTÉ Radio 1\'s News At One Economics and Public Affairs Editor, David Murphy on how the consumer price index provides further evidence of the continuing rise in the cost of living\r\n\r\nThese domestic developments unfold against substantial European investment. The European Union has committed approximately €150 billion toward digital infrastructure through the Next Generation EU Recovery Fund, explicitly assuming that expanded digital access will benefit consumers and reduce inequalities. The EU Digital Finance Strategy emphasises market competition and innovation while assuming consumer benefit follows automatically from increased choice and reduced costs.\r\n\r\nIreland\'s experience suggests these assumptions warrant re-examination. Ireland ranks fifth in the EU on the Digital Economy and Society Index, with 70% of the population possessing basic digital skills compared to 54% across the EU. If technology is failing to improve consumer welfare in such a digitally advanced economy, the challenges may prove greater still in member states with lower baseline digital literacy or weaker consumer protection frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe research points toward several policy directions. First, preserving non-digital alternatives remains important, as evidenced by the superior outcomes achieved by rural residents with lower technology adoption. The EU is moving in this direction. Irish Commissioner Mairead McGuinness\'s 2023 proposal to protect cash advanced in December 2025 when the European Council agreed to effectively ban retailers from refusing cash payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom RTÉ Brainstorm, why banks need to maintain cash services for customers\r\n\r\nSecond, moving beyond access to capability development is essential. Providing tools without the skills to use them effectively serves limited purpose. Third, addressing structural economic barriers must accompany technological solutions, as no app can resolve the housing crisis or employment precarity. Finally, regulatory frameworks should require evidence of actual welfare improvements rather than engagement metrics.\r\n\r\n\'An early warning\'\r\nAs digital finance regulation evolves under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, the Digital Operational Resilience Act, and the AI Act, these findings suggest current frameworks may inadequately protect middle-income consumers. The squeezed middle, representing approximately 3.9 million Irish residents and potentially over 200 million Europeans, experiences no benefit from digital finance despite having access to it.\r\n\r\nThe digital transformation of financial services is irreversible, yet the focus of digital service design has yet to consider the real lived experiences of squeezed households. Measuring success by downloads, logins and transaction volumes rather than genuine improvements in financial wellbeing may be leading policy in unproductive directions. Ireland\'s experience offers an early warning for other European member states pursuing similar digitalisation strategies.\r\n\r\nThe Squeezed Middle in Digital Financial Services: Ireland\'s Warning for European Consumer Protection Policy is published in the Journal of Consumer Policy. It was compiled by Dr Marie Ryan, Dr Huanhuan Xiong, Dr Fergal Carton and Dr JB McCarthy from the Cork University Business School at UCC\r\n\r\nFollow RTÉ Brainstorm on WhatsApp and Instagram for more stories and updates\r\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and do not represent or reflect the views of RTÉ\r\n', 'images/04_How_digital_banking_is_not_having_benefits_for_Irish_households.webp', 4, 1, 1, '2026-02-23 15:08:31', '2026-02-23 15:08:31'),

This matters a lot for a software name like Workday, where much of the debate is about future profitability rather than near term results.</p><p>Here, the market is assigning a higher price to Workday’s earnings than to many peers, even though the company recently reported negative earnings growth over the past year, a lower net profit margin of 7% compared to 19.9% a year ago, and a Return on Equity of 7.2% that is described as low.</p><p>Against the US Software industry average P/E of 30.9x and an estimated fair P/E of 46.3x, Workday’s 75x multiple stands out as materially richer. This gap points to expectations that would need strong execution to sustain at this level or a potential move closer to the fair ratio over time.</p><p>Explore the SWS fair ratio for Workday</p><p>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 75x (OVERVALUED)</p><p>However, you still need to weigh risks such as a premium 75x P/E multiple, a recent 1-year total shareholder return decline of 27%, and a 5-year total return decline of 22.3%.</p><p>Find out about the key risks to this Workday narrative.</p><p>Another view on Workday’s value</p><p>While the 75x P/E suggests Workday is expensive, our DCF model points in the opposite direction, with the shares trading at US$182.99 compared to an estimated future cash flow value of US$346.05. That gap frames Workday as undervalued on cash flows. This raises the question of which signal might be more informative.</p><p>Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.</p><p>WDAY Discounted Cash Flow as at Jan 2026</p><p>WDAY Discounted Cash Flow as at Jan 2026</p><p>Simply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (check out Workday for example).

Will it work? There are reasons to be doubtful: earlier attempts to create a Capital Markets Union have failed, marred by bureaucracy and national protectionism. For this new push to fare better, a drastically new strategy is needed.</p><p>A recent report by a team of market practitioners and academic experts assembled by Milan’s Bocconi University suggests a way. The focus must be reversed: no longer grand institutional design fostering integration and harmonisation but rather pragmatic steps to unlock capital for growth-enhancing sectors. The aim should be to obtain concrete results first and prepare for more ambitious reform steps later.</p><p>None of the steps require changing Europe’s foundational treaties, major legislative overhaul or even the unanimous participation of all countries. For most actions, a critical mass of private initiative with national support suffices.</p><p>Two recommendations aim at channelling Europe’s deep pool of household savings to more productive use. Properly structured saving and retirement accounts would offer individual savers simple, tax-advantaged portable vehicles for long-term investment. Sweden’s investment accounts should be the model. Instruments of the sort already existing in embryonic form in other countries would be expanded and aligned. Even a small reallocation of household savings would release significant resources for equity investment and venture financing.</p><p>Another step would establish a euro-wide listing platform for firms that are scaling up. Europe is strong at producing start-ups but weak at supporting their growth and maturation. Funding gaps widen as they expand, the shortage of risk-bearing capital becoming acute in the scale-up phase. This has consequences. In spite of an abundant supply of local savings, many young promising European firms choose to raise capital abroad. Capital raising often occurs on US exchanges and in dollars, attracted by deeper liquidity and higher valuations. Other firms give up on going public entirely and are acquired before they can scale. Europe continues to generate innovation but struggles to retain the value it creates.</p><p>A capital-raising platform with easier access to saving pools right across Europe would give innovative European firms wishing to go public a reason to list in their home region, rather than go abroad as they do now. Such an instrument does not require institutional centralisation; it requires co-ordination and design.</p><p>Two additional proposals address today’s practical impediments to cross-border investment: custodian barriers, settlement frictions and an under-developed securitisation market. Post-trading mobility can be significantly improved within the existing infrastructure through wider and more effective use of T2S, the ECB-managed securities settlement, and simplified, interoperable custodian arrangements.</p><p>Recommended</p><p>Markets InsightMichael Theurer</p><p>Europe needs to tackle a home bias of banks</p><p>Likewise, a revitalised securitisation framework — transparent, standardised and market-friendly — would allow banks to recycle balance-sheet capacity towards innovative firms, precisely where short-term liquidity often matters most. Two conditions are needed to reactivate securitisation in Europe: market-friendly regulation to remove the stigma the sector has had since the Great Financial Crisis and a market-making platform making bid-ask offers for a range of standard products. The latter should be private, but its birth requires a degree of European official support.</p><p>An enhanced role and responsibility should be given to the European Investment Bank. The bank already serves as an anchor for investors across European venture ecosystems. A more strategic role — including backing the new securitisation conduit and supporting venture debt — would amplify existing impact without changing the EIB’s institutional profile or increasing its capital.</p><p>None of the above proposals is a substitute for deeper integration. Europe will, in the long run, benefit from a coherent legal and supervisory environment and from more aligned taxation and insolvency laws. But waiting for this idealised future has already consumed a decade and would risk the same fate as earlier ones: grand announcements followed by delays, obstacles and eventual stalemate. That is the last thing Europe needs as it faces economic stagnation and its strategic future is darkened by American unilateralism and Russian aggression.</p>', 'images/14_The_EU’s_capital_market_strategy_must_support_innovation.avif', 14, 3, 5, '2026-02-23 15:08:31', '2026-02-23 15:08:31'),

(16, 'What does Finance Bill 2025 mean for the financial services industry?', 'Finance Bill 2025 and the Future of Financial Services', 'From tax adjustments to regulatory updates, the Finance Bill 2025 is set to have wide-ranging consequences for firms operating across the financial services landscape', '<p>Finance Bill 2025 is a broadly constructive package for financial services taxpayers that modernises the code, supports investment and in part makes a number of necessary surgical changes. On balance, most measures will be welcomed by financial services taxpayers. The participation exemption reforms, coupled with the introduction of a targeted dividend withholding tax exemption on payments made to regulated partnerships in particular, significantly enhance the Irish product suite in an asset management context. A notable disappointment is the changes made to Section 840A. While the Bill does provide a carve-out to disapply the interest restriction where certain connected-party loans meet lender-taxation and commercial purpose criteria, the amendment does not go far enough to address the practical constraints that Section 840A imposes on ordinary group financing, refinancing and asset reorganisation transactions.</p><p>Overall, while not substantive, the remainder of the Bill contains measures that will be welcomed for enhancing certainty, competitiveness and administrative clarity across the tax code.</p><p>An abstract image of a building</p><p>Key measures introduced in the Bill from a financial services perspective are as follows:</p><p>Dividend Withholding Tax exemption for payments to regulated partnerships</p><p>The Bill brings into legislation a long-awaited dividend withholding tax exemption for payments from Irish companies to an Irish-regulated investment limited partnership (ILP) or an EEA-equivalent partnership. The exemption will be available where:</p><p>the partners are beneficially entitled to at least 51% of the ordinary share capital in the dividend paying company;</p><p>the ordinary share capital of the dividend paying company is an asset of the ILP/equivalent; and</p><p>the investment limited partnership has provided the dividend paying company with the relevant declaration to state it is such an ILP/equivalent.</p><p>The interaction with the recently amended outbound payment rules will require further clarification in the context of widely held funds. However, clarification that the ILP will constitute the beneficial owner for the purpose of making the necessary declarations is welcome. Overall, a very positive development for the Irish collective investment product suite — particularly for private assets.</p><p>Participation Exemption Regime</p><p>The Bill introduces a series of technical amendments to the dividend participation exemption regime established by Finance Act 2024. These amendments represent incremental steps toward enhancing the regime and aligning it more closely to international holding company standards.</p><p>Pillar Two and securitisation entities</p><p>The Bill helpfully clarifies that orphan-owned entities that are fully consolidated into a multinational entity (MNE) group are considered to be “minority owned constituent entities” (MOCEs) for Pillar Two purposes. The legislation further confirms that a securitisation entity that is a MOCE shall calculate its top-up tax in line with the MOCE provisions (i.e. on a standalone basis), but any resulting top-up tax will be allocated to the other Irish entities that are not securitisation entities.</p><p>Although this aligns with the previous interpretation of OECD rules, it is a positive development for the Irish securitisation industry and those entities in scope as it offers certainty of the level of tax to be applied at the securitisation entity level.</p><p>Leasing amendments</p><p>Section 840A was introduced in Finance Act 2011 to counter perceived base erosion through intra-group asset transfer and financing arrangements that generated Irish interest deductions. Its broad drafting captured assets such as aircraft and loans, inadvertently impacting genuine commercial transactions and group reorganisations.</p><p>Revenue later issued eBrief 11/11 to carve out certain assets — such as those used in leasing trades — but its removal late last year has created uncertainty, particularly for the leasing sector where intra-group transfers are common.</p><p>The Bill introduces a new subsection to Section 840A, providing a carve-out from interest restrictions where specific conditions are met:</p><p>the seller must have borrowed to acquire the asset and claimed a tax deduction in Ireland;</p><p>the lender must be taxable in Ireland, the EU or a DTA country; and</p><p>the loan must be commercially motivated, not tax-driven.</p><p>Importantly, the buyer’s deductible interest is capped by the seller’s outstanding principal immediately before the sale. Where only part of the seller’s borrowings relate to the asset, a “just and reasonable” apportionment is allowed. This cap presents practical challenges, especially in tracing historic debt and accommodating commercial financing structures. It may also lead to inequitable outcomes in Irish-to-Irish transactions that were not the original intent of the legislation.</p><p>The new rules apply to transfers of assets within the scope of Section 840A that take place on or after 1 January 2024, thus opening the door to potential self-corrections in respect of transfers in 2024. The impact of this retrospective application will need to be considered further in the coming days.</p><p>These revisions add complexity at a time when a broader consultation is expected to simplify the interest regime. Given the evolved tax landscape and existing anti-avoidance rules, the continued relevance of Section 840A is increasingly questioned, and this latest amendment is seen as a missed opportunity for reform.</p><p>Retail investment</p><p>The tax rate on payments made from Irish funds, equivalent offshore funds, as well as Irish and foreign life assurance policies to Irish individual investors (i.e. exit tax and life assurance exit tax) has been lowered from 41% to 38% with effect from 1 January 2026. While we had hoped that the eight-year deemed disposal rule would be abolished and that the exit tax and life assurance exit tax rates would be fully aligned with the 33% rate of capital gains tax (CGT) in this year’s Bill, it is hoped that the reduced exit tax is but a first step and that the 2026 roadmap announced in Budget 2026 will provide a clear timeframe to address and implement the remaining recommendations in the ‘Fund Sector 2030’ (PDF) Report.</p><p>Technology and innovation</p><p>Ireland is well-positioned to be a leading innovator in the global financial services industry by harnessing our position as both a leading financial services hub and the extensive digital skills within our economy, linked to the presence of some of the largest technology companies in the world. The stepped-up R&D credit (to 35%) with cleaner payment mechanics, clearer continuity and carry-forward rules for specified intangible assets in reconstruction scenarios are all welcome in this context.</p><p>These measures, in addition to a refinement of the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP), signal a clear intention to optimise Ireland’s tax system for international investment both in the financial services space and beyond.</p><p>Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)</p><p>The OECD’s CARF ushers in a new era of automatic exchange of information for crypto-assets, closing long-recognised transparency gaps as activity shifts away from traditional intermediaries. DAC 8 introduces new tax transparency rules for crypto-assets within the EU, adopting the CARF for that purpose.</p><p>Ireland has implemented DAC 8 through the Bill, with the first reporting under CARF due by 31 May 2027 in respect of the 2026 reporting period. Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) must register with Revenue by 31 December 2026.</p><p>The CARF provides for the automatic exchange of tax relevant-information on crypto-assets. An individual or entity is deemed to be a RCASP if, as a business, it provides a service effectuating exchange transactions for, or on behalf of, customers in respect of relevant crypto assets. Notably, CARF requires transaction-level reporting and imposes several due diligence obligations on RCASPs.</p><p>Entities and individuals should now assess whether they should be viewed as RCASPs under CARF and begin upgrading systems and processes to effectively manage obligations.</p><p>Common Reporting Standard (CRS) 2.0</p><p>In addition to implementing the CARF, and following a comprehensive review by the OECD, DAC 8 also adopted the changes to CRS/DAC 2.</p><p>These amendments are designed to capture emerging financial assets and products that serve as alternatives to traditional offerings, and to bring additional entities within the scope of the CRS. Among other updates, enhanced due diligence obligations have been introduced as well as several changes to the reporting obligations.</p><p>Other financial services measures</p><p>Exempt unit trusts</p><p>Chargeable gains accruing to exempt unit trusts may no longer be treated as wholly exempt from CGT where the units in the EUT are held by an investment undertaking.</p><p>Auto-enrolment and investment undertakings</p><p>Participants in an auto-enrolment scheme have been added to the list of Irish investors exempt from exit tax on payments from Irish investment undertakings.</p><p>Foreign body corporates</p><p>A new Section 1009A provides that a foreign body corporate and its members will be chargeable to tax on the basis that the foreign body corporate is a partnership, where it is substantially similar to an Irish partnership. This amendment provides legislative clarity to taxpayers. However, it may interact with several other tax provisions relevant to cross-border structures which should be monitored as we move through the legislative process.</p><p>Bank levy</p><p>The bank levy has been extended for another year with changes to the base year and the rate. The levy to be charged in 2026 will be based on the eligible deposits held by each relevant institution as at the end of 2024 (previously 2022). The rate of levy applied to the base has been changed from 0.112% to 0.1025% for 2026, to achieve the target yield of €200 million.</p><p>Life assurance</p><p>No reference was made to the 1% life assurance levy, which the industry hopes will be abolished off the back of the recommendations included in the Funds Sector 2030 report. However, the implementation plan refers to ‘detailed consideration’ being given to the recommendations in this area.</p><p>As noted, however, the exit tax rate on life assurance policies will be reduced from 41% to 38%.</p>', 'images/16_What_does_Finance_Bill_2025_mean_for_the_financial_services_industry.webp', 16, 3, 1, '2026-02-23 15:08:31', '2026-02-23 15:08:31'),

He cites faith in Cohen’s leadership and the stock trading near tangible book value.', '<p>In 2021, Michael Burry helped ignite the meme stock frenzy by accumulating a 5% stake in GameStop (NYSE:GME) through his Scion Asset Management fund. He pushed management to repurchase shares, citing undervaluation as video games were making a shift toward digital and downloads. Burry\'s activism drew the attention of Chewy (NASDAQ:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen, who built his own 13% position in the stock, advocating for similar changes.</p><p>This, in turn, caught the eye of Reddit users on WallStreetBets, who coordinated buys to squeeze short sellers. The result was GameStop stock surging over 1,600% in a matter of weeks, sparking a broader retail trading boom.</p><p>Now, Burry has disclosed via his Substack that he\'s buying GameStop stock again, citing faith in Cohen\'s leadership and the stock\'s proximity to tangible book value. This news, following Cohen\'s recent purchase of 1 million shares, boosted the video game retailer\'s shares more than 12% over the past week.</p><p>GameStop: The Original Meme Stock Icon</p><p>GameStop became the symbol of the meme stock movement in early 2021, when retail investors drove its price from under $5 to a split-adjusted peak of $86.88 per share. The frenzy highlighted how social media could challenge institutional shorts, with GameStop\'s meteoric rise inspiring similar runs in stocks like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Traders hunted for other heavily shorted names, aiming to replicate the squeeze. We\'ve seen similar attempts recently with stocks like Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN), yet GameStop remains the OG meme stock, as its story defined the era.</p><p>A Tough Road Since the Peak</p><p>The past few years, however, have tested GameStop, and shares have fallen 72% from its peak to around $24. The problem remains its core business faces secular headwinds. Hardware and accessories sales dropped 12% year-over-year in the third quarter to $367.4 million, while software sales plunged 27% to $197.5 million. Overall net sales declined 4.6% to $821 million, missing estimates of $987 million. The shift to digital downloads and streaming erodes demand for physical products, limiting GameStop\'s growth.</p><p>Despite the declines, collectibles stand out as a singular growth area. Last quarter, segment sales rose 50% to $256.1 million, representing 31% of revenue compared to 20% a year prior. Items like trading cards and Funko Pops helped lift gross margins to 33.3% from 29.9%, contributing to operating income of $41.3 million against a prior loss. Still, this pivot doesn\'t fully offset GameStop\'s core erosion, and collectibles depend on consumer trends that can shift quickly.</p><p>Key Takeaway</p><p>Burry views GameStop as undervalued, trading near 1x tangible book value with Cohen steering capital deployment for long-term potential. He downplays short squeezes, focusing on fundamentals. Still, investors should proceed cautiously.</p><p>The video game industry\'s digital evolution continues pressuring sales, and collectibles\' volatility ties to fickle tastes. Cohen has tried numerous tactics to inject new life into the business, such as launching a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace when NFTs were hot, and climbing on the crypto treasury company bandwagon as Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) soared. At the end of Q3, GameStop owned 4,710 bitcoin at a time when the crypto was trading just north of $110,000, producing an unrealized loss of $9.2 million and a cumulative $19.4 million unrealized gain. Bitcoin is down about 20% since then.</p><p>So despite profitability gains from collectibles and cost cuts, revenue trends signal ongoing challenges. That means just because Burry is buying, you shouldn\'t follow his lead and buy, too.</p>', 'images/22_“Big_Short”_Investor_Michael_Burry_is_Betting_on_GameStop’s_Revival_—_Time_to_Buy.jpg', 22, 5, 3, '2026-02-23 15:08:31', '2026-02-23 15:08:31'),

(26, 'Will Sugar’s Bearish Trend End in 2026?', 'Will Sugar’s Downtrend Reverse in 2026?', 'After an extended period of weakness, sugar prices face key technical and fundamental tests in 2026—could this be the year the bearish trend finally loses steam?', '<p>I asked how low world sugar futures prices could fall in a November 11, 2025, Barchart article. I concluded with the following:</p><p>I believe that sugar is approaching a price where commodity cyclicality will create a bottom, leading to a price recovery. However, picking a bottom is virtually impossible when a market is making lower highs and lower lows. Therefore, I favor a scale-down approach to sugar, leaving plenty of room to add on further declines.</p><p>Nearby March ICE sugar futures were trading at 14.20 cents per pound on November 10, 2025. In my January 9, 2026, Barchart quarterly report on soft commodities, I wrote:</p><p>Time will tell if cotton and sugar prices can recover in 2026, but cyclicality favors the upside.</p><p>March sugar futures closed 2025 at 15.01 cents per pound. At just below the 15-cent level in late January, world sugar futures are consolidating near their recent lows.</p><p>A bearish trend since November 2023</p><p>Sugar prices have been trending lower since late 2023, but have held above 14 cents per pound.</p><p>The monthly continuous ICE world sugar futures contract chart shows that the sweet commodity moved 50.11% lower from the November 2023 high of 28.14 cents to the November 2025 low of 14.04 cents per pound. While sugar futures have remained above 14 cents per pound, the price was just below 15 cents per pound in late January 2026.</p><p>Sugar is the most liquid soft commodity</p><p>The soft commodities sector of the commodities asset class includes world sugar, Arabica coffee, cocoa, cotton, and frozen concentrated orange juice. World sugar is the most liquid soft commodity with the highest daily volume and open interest, the total number of open long and short positions.</p><p>Since world sugar has the highest liquidity, it is the only soft commodity with an ETF that tracks its price action. The Teucrium Sugar ETF (CANE) stands alone as the only soft commodity ETF. Another product, the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA), provides exposure to most of the soft commodities, but CANE is the only dedicated sugar ETF product.</p><p>Sugar- A critical ingredient for food and energy</p><p>Sugar is a critical agricultural product, with many producing countries subsidizing their domestic sugar production. In the U.S., sugar #16 is the subsidized sugar futures contract that trades at a significant premium to world sugar #11 futures due to the U.S. government subsidies.</p><p>Sugar is not only a food ingredient, but it is also an agricultural ingredient in ethanol production in Brazil, the world’s leading sugarcane-producing country. While corn is the ingredient in U.S. ethanol production, Brazil uses its sugar output to produce biofuel.</p><p>Levels to watch and the reasons for a long position</p><p>After over two years of a bearish trend, ICE world sugar futures #11 have moved into a narrow trading range.</p><p>The chart shows that the daily continuous sugar #11 futures contract has traded between 14.35 and 15.34 cents per pound since November 14, 2025. At 14.96 cents on January 21, the sugar futures were in the middle of the narrow trading range.</p><p>From a longer-term perspective, technical support is at the October 2025 low of 14.04 cents per pound, with technical resistance at the August 2024 low of 17.52 cents per pound. A move below 14 cents or above 17.52 cents per pound could create a technical break that may lead to follow-through selling or buying.</p><p>The current price consolidation could signal a bottom, as commodity cyclicality below 15 cents could prompt producers to scale back output, leading to declining inventories and increased consumption. In commodities, the cure for low prices is typically those low prices.</p><p>CANE is the ETF that tracks a portfolio of ICE world sugar futures</p><p>At $9.65 per share, the Teucrium Sugar ETF (CANE) had nearly $13.6 million in assets under management. CANE trades an average of 44,436 shares per day and charges a 0.93% management fee. To mitigate roll risk when one ICE world sugar number 11 rolls from one active month to the next, CANE owns three ICE sugar futures contracts, excluding the nearby contract. CANE tends to underperform sugar futures on the upside and outperform the nearby contract on the downside, as most speculative activity occurs in the nearby active month contract.</p><p>The continuous sugar futures contract fell just over 50% from the high in November 2023 to the low in November 2025.</p><p>The monthly chart shows that the CANE ETF declined 41.2% over the same period, from $15.51 to $9.12 per share, outperforming the priced action in the continuous ICE sugar futures contract.</p><p>Commodity cyclicality suggests that sugar prices could be closer to a potential low than a high in 2026, making the risk-reward on a long position attractive.</p><p>On the date of publication, Andrew Hecht did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The figures reflect advertised pay, indicating how employers are positioning roles in the current job market.</p><p>The research reveals that full-time employees in Ireland earned an advertised median gross salary of €54,928 in 2025. Professionals in Ireland are well compensated compared to their counterparts across Europe, with a median advertised salary of €38,304 (£33,526) in the UK and €53,900 in Germany.</p><p>The insights are based on an analysis of advertised salary and benefit trends from 1.3 million job adverts across the Irish labour market, alongside survey insights from 470 recruiters and 670 candidates in Ireland. The salary research was carried out by IrishJobs parent company, The Stepstone Group, as part of a study of salary trends in markets including Ireland, the UK, and Germany.</p><p>With the EU’s new pay transparency legislation coming into effect this June, the study found that only 38% of advertised roles currently include salary information. Findings show that roles in the IT and Banking & Finance sectors had the highest median advertised salary at €80,000. This was closely followed by the Construction (€75,000) and Legal (€75,000) sectors. €70,000 was the median annual advertised salary in both the Engineering and Healthcare sectors.</p><p>Rising wages</p><p>The research shows strong wage growth across the Irish economy in response to inflationary pressures. 58% of professionals reported receiving a pay increase in 2025. 6% was the average level of pay rise reported in 2025. More than 1 in 3 workers (34%) received a modest pay increase of 2-3%, while 27% of professionals received a pay rise of 4-5%. 77% of professionals said they were satisfied with the level of pay increase received.</p><p>Two-track workforce</p><p>Findings show a growing divide across the workforce between those looking to change jobs and those looking to stay in their current job for stability. 44% of professionals are looking for a new job in 2026, typically those with in-demand skills are more open to moving. 76% say salary is the most important factor when choosing a job.</p><p>In contrast, 43% of professionals in Ireland plan on staying in the same role this year. Of those, over half (54%) report that they are satisfied with the level of their salary. Job security is the key element determining churn. More than half (52%) of professionals say that they don’t want to leave their current employer due to job security.</p><p>Mobility is strongest for those with scarce skills in this two-track job market. With the skills requirements across many industries evolving at pace, investment in upskilling and reskilling programmes will be crucial to ensure the future mobility of sections of the workforce.</p><p>In-demand skills</p><p>As employers navigate a competitive labour market, skills are increasingly driving pay decisions. Recruiting workers with in-demand skills (61%) was the top factor influencing salary decisions among employers in Ireland last year. While specialist and technical skills are in high demand within specific industries, employers are more broadly focused on soft skills.</p><p>Leadership & people management skills are the most in-demand capabilities, which are most likely to yield a higher salary. Project management and technical skills made up the top three in-demand skills that are likely to lead to a higher salary.</p><p>Top occupations</p><p>Findings show that Senior finance managers commanded the highest annual salary in 2025, with a median advertised salary of €100,000. Risk managers (€85,000) also had one of the highest advertised salaries in the banking and finance sectors. Senior software engineers had the highest annual advertised median salary in the IT sector at €95,000.</p><p>€80,000 was the highest advertised salary in the construction sector for Site operations managers, while Senior engineers earned the top salary (€85,000) in the engineering sector. Recent IrishJobs data revealed that 8 in 10 of the most in-demand professions in 2025 were in construction and related sectors, with salaries growing in response to high levels of demand for skilled professionals across these sectors.</p><p>Employee benefits</p><p>The research revealed that benefits and total rewards packages are as important to professionals as salary. Health insurance is the top benefit sought by talent, closely followed by flexible working. Pension contributions above legal requirements, performance bonus or commission and sick pay above legal requirements make up the top five most highly sought-after benefits.</p><p>56% of professionals say they wouldn’t consider applying for a role without hybrid or remote working arrangements, while more than half (53%) say they wouldn’t apply for roles that don’t provide clear career progression. These findings indicate that employers must increasingly compete on the full talent package offering in attracting and retaining talent, not only a competitive salary package.</p><p>Regional trends</p><p>The data shows regional differences in advertised salaries across Ireland. Dublin is the county with the highest median advertised salary at €60,000. Galway has the second-highest annual median salary (€52,000), driven by a vibrant life science, healthcare and education sectors. Cork (€46,200) has the third-highest median annual salary.</p><p>Commenting on the release of the findings, Christopher Paye, Country Director of The Stepstone Group Ireland with responsibility for IrishJobs, said: “A positive albeit slowing rate of jobs growth is forecast for the Irish economy in 2026. With the rate of domestic demand set to grow by 2.8% according to Ibec’s latest economic outlook, Ireland will remain ahead of most other European economies. With the rate of unemployment also expected to remain low, these indicators show that employers in Ireland will continue to navigate a highly competitive market for talent this year.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the IrishJobs Salary Trends Report provides an important insight into key salary and benefits trends as employers adapt their offering to better attract and retain high-calibre talent in this competitive environment.</p><p>It’s clear from our findings that salary is still the core component driving churn in the labour market. Nearly half of professionals are seeking to change jobs over the coming months, with a higher salary being their main motivator for seeking a new position. However, there are signs of a two-track labour market in effect, with mobility strongest among professionals with in-demand skills. With elevated economic uncertainty on the horizon, job security is being prioritised by the majority of professionals who plan on staying in the same position this year.</p><p>With many employers already providing salary increases in 2025 and struggling to keep pace with the demand for higher wages, organisations should reevaluate their employment offering and consider wider benefits to create a strong proposition for talent that meets their evolving needs. Providing flexible and hybrid working options remains high on the agenda for jobseekers and can provide a key differentiator for attracting and retaining talent without breaking the bank. Findings show that health and wellbeing is increasingly being prioritised by jobseekers, with health insurance ranked as the most in-demand benefit among professionals surveyed.</p><p>Our analysis found that currently 38% of job ads display salary information—but that is set to change. With the EU’s new pay transparency legislation coming into force in June, 2026 will be a significant year for salary disclosure, increasing openness around pay and reshaping how employers advertise roles and how candidates assess opportunities.”</p><p>For more information, visit: https://www.irishjobs.ie/</p>', 'images/27_IT,_Finance,_and_Construction_top_salary_rankings_according_to_IrishJobs.webp', 27, 2, 1, '2026-02-23 15:08:31', '2026-02-23 15:08:31'),
